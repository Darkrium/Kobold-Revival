		"Our Lost Sons had not returned for many moons on their journey to appease the Lady of Chance. During these nights we heard the bone chilling howls of wolves, we pray that we will at least have remains to send back to the flame.
		The howls in the dark grow nearer with each passing moon. We fear we have not long before our end has come.
		As day broke and we welcomed the Sun's safety and warmth, our blood ran cold as we were greeted by the visages of predators. To our relief, it was our once Lost Sons in the Guise of wolves.
		However my worries have not been placated. Our Sons refuse to part with their wolven pelts, wearing them more often then not. And these pelts, they glow eerily with life."
