		"It is odd enough for an Apex like myself to be surrounded by such savage beasts as these kobolds.  Indeed, were it not for the Miniknog's relentless pursuit of this scholar, I would not have stopped in their untidy little village.

		But what I have found most curious of all is how the beasts deal with death.  They are a flimsy people with little in the way of weaponry or armour, so death is not uncommon for them.  Indeed, a harsh end greets most of them.  Many take this in stride, simply continuing on with their own lives.  

		Those who cannot become what the kobolds call 'The Forlorn."
